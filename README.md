# RolandDriverPatcher
 Herbert Schmitt's Roland Driver Patcher source code, as it was never uploaded to Github.

This is a mirror repository of [Herbert Schmitt's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOAYvDwHYX7iIXdZBp_sW1Q) Roland Driver Patcher tool. It was only uploaded to MEGA, and never hosted as a Github repository.
The original can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#!VU11majS!tJxwauVbfj8Cd2uCFW-S8hzC1sCvqYzjz85sCTLQ44M), with a tutorial video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2aSb4q2Kvw) and Windows build [here](https://mega.nz/file/YNMBGIrT#hPDxGRQ6-VoSQtxURe4fEwr5b5jCKoELjvqsFBrko0M).

## Description - What is this?
Many of Roland/Edirol's old devices do not work with Windows 10, as it is not supported. This tool aims to fix that by patching the Roland drivers for the corresponding device you want to patch.
Unfortunately, in order to apply these patches, you'll need to boot into a version of Windows that has driver signature checking disabled, or else it won't work. This can be done by going through the [Advanced Startup Options](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode-b90e7808-80b5-a291-d4b8-1a1af602b617) and picking the seventh option.

### Am I updating this?
Potentially, but I see no reason to make changes to it, since people have already reported that it still works.
